    "Progress of my work : After some weeks of reverse-engineering the OpenRetina scripts, I understood them enough to work direclty on them. L. Perrinet and I built some testing scripts that allowed me to try these scripts. The first one, with a fully-noised input, was run successfully. I still have some problems to run the second one, that use a local camera as an input.\n",
