    "I'll try to build the script into a class, to save parameters between each frame iteration. Or use openCV again (but we try to use it as little as possible to avoid compiling as mush as possible, and MoviePy is only composed of python scripts, contrary to openCV that contain a lot of C scripts).  \n",
    "I need to integrate : recording of a video file by the Pi, sending that file -frame by frame- to server upon request, that may (or may not) do some processing.  \n",
